Promise.js
==========
A Promises/A+ framework with small a footprint, originally developed for the <a href="https://github.com/kaerus/arango-client">ArangoDB client</a> library. 

Main features
-------------
* Conforming to the Promises/A+ specification: passing all tests.
* Small footprint: 600 bytes compressed / 1400 bytes minified.
* Simple design: easy to understand, intergrate & debug.
* Runtime independent: Can be loaded as an AMD or CommonJS module. 
* Resolves multiple values: Fulfillments & rejections can yield more than one value.

Install
=======
Include the promise.js file into your project using an AMD compatible loader.
You need to have ```amdefine``` to be able to require it as a CommmonJS module in node.js. 
A minified built file is included in dist/promise.js.

Usage
=====
```Javascript
/* Run an asynchronous process that returns a promise.   */
/* Note: The promise doesn't have to originate from this */
/* library as long as it is Promises/A+ compliant....... */
promise = getAjax("http://some.host.com/data");

/* When the response arives, it calls either */
/* the fulfilled block or the rejected block.*/
promise.then(function(value){
	console.log("fulfilled:", value);
},function(reason){
	console.log("rejected:", reason);
});
```

```javascript
/* chaining promises, (undefined blocks are ignored) */
promise = new Promise();

promise.then(function(value){
	return value + 1;	
}).then(function(value){
	if(value < 5) throw "value is to small";
	console.log("value:", value);
}).then(undefined,function(error){
	/* catch thrown error here */
	console.log(error);
});

/* fulfill with a random value */
promise.fulfill(Math.floor(Math.random()*10));
```

```javascript
/* promises can only be fulfilled/rejected once */
var promise = new Promise();

/* fulfill a promise with a submitted form value */
function onSubmit(){
	promise.fulfill(getElementById("formInput").val());
}

/* Reject the promise on cancel */
function onCancel(){
	promise.reject("Aborted");
}

/* setup the response chain */
promise.then(function(url) {
	var ajaxedPromise = getAjax(url);

	return ajaxedPromise.then(function(data){
		return data;
	},function(error){
		return "Failed to fetch content";
	});
}).then(function(response){
	/* put response into DOM */
	var e = getElementById('content');
	e.innerHTML = response;
},function(error){
	/* if rejected from either onCancel */
	/* or thrown error, we end up here. */
	var e = getElementById('error-message');
	e.innerHTML = error.message;
});
```
```javascript
/* This Promise library supports multiple fulfillment values (not only one) */
promise().fulfill("abc",123,{abc:123}).then(function(a,b,c) {
	console.log("a(%s) b(%s) c(%s)", a, b, c);
});

```


Test & build
============
Install the development requirements using ```npm i -d```.
Then run ```make``` for executing the tests and building/minifying into dist.
